* Transmission of messages is now working well.
  * There are still a number of boundary checks and features that need to be implemented, but these will be implemented as needed.
  * Only a single buffer (buffer 1) is currently implemented.
* Receiving messages is not yet implemented. This is the next step in the development of the module.
